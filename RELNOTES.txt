                            Release Notes for
                        Helix Authentication Extension
                            Version 2025.1


Introduction

    The Helix Authentication Extension is a Helix Core Server extension that
    integrates with the Helix Authentication Service to facilitate the
    integration of identity providers supporting either the OpenID Connect or
    SAML 2.0 authentication protocols.

    Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCC, for example 2002.2/30547. YYYY is
    the year; R is the release of that year; CCCCC is the bug fix change level.
    Each bug fix in these release notes is marked by its change number. Any
    build includes (1) all bug fixes for all previous releases and (2) all bug
    fixes for the current release up to the bug fix change level.


Important Notes

    Logging out of a Helix Core or Helix ALM client does not invoke a logout
    with the identity provider (IdP). Depending on the IdP, subsequently
    starting a Helix Core or Helix ALM client might result with the user being
    logged in again without the user being prompted to provide credentials.


Supported Platforms

    Linux (x86_64)
        RHEL 7, 8, 9
        CentOS 7, 8.0
        Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04

    The above platforms are tested and subject to regression testing on a
    frequent basis. Errors or bugs discovered in these platforms are prioritized
    for correction. Any platform not listed above is not actively tested by
    Perforce.

    Support for Ubuntu 20.04 will be removed in the next release.


Requirements

    Helix Core Server 2019.1 or higher


Documentation

    The Helix Authentication Extension Administrator's Guide is publicly
    available on GitHub at the URL below:

        https://github.com/perforce/helix-authentication-extension

    The guide details the steps for installation, upgrade, and configuration of
    the server extension.


Known Limitations

    Perforce cannot guarantee and has not exhaustively tested the compatibility
    of 3rd Party Plugins with the Helix Authentication Service. It is up to each
    3rd party plugin owner to make his/her plugin compatible.

    Users authenticating with the Helix Server will likely need to use one of
    the supported clients to authenticate. Once a valid P4 ticket has been
    acquired, then clients other than those listed above should function
    normally. In particular, the clients need to handle the `invokeURL` feature
    added in the 2019.1 P4API. This includes the P4API-derived clients
    (P4Python, P4Ruby, etc) which at this time do not yet support this feature.

    P4Eclipse

        When using P4Eclipse, you must authenticate using one of the clients
        listed above under the **Requirements** section. Then, when setting up
        the initial P4 connection in P4Eclipse, you are prompted for a user and
        password. Only put in the username and leave the password field blank.
        The client will then use the existing connection.

    P4SL

        When using P4SL, you must authenticate using one of the clients listed
        above under the **Requirements** section. Then, when setting up the
        initial P4 connection in P4SL, you are prompted for a user and password.
        Only put in the username and leave the password field blank. The client
        will then use the existing connection.

    IntelliJ (3rd Party Plugin)

        When logging in to Perforce using IntelliJ, it will prompt for a
        password but also open the browser to the identity provider. Once you
        have authenticated with the IdP and acquired a P4 ticket, IntelliJ will
        still be waiting for a password. Submit that login request and let it
        fail, after which IntelliJ will operate normally.
